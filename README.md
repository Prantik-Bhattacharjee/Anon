# Anon
Introduction
Anon aims to be one of a kind app that will facilitate WhatsApp Messaging and WhatsApp Calling without having to save the recipients contact info
This idea originates from people’s need for quick messaging to unknown contacts, on the go!

Proposed Work
Our Idea is to use an API (application programming interface) provided by Whatsapp public on it’s website. 

Issues our APP aims to resolve are:
Women often encounter it uncomfortable in saving contact info of strangers for various reasons.Thus they can easily make use of ANON to contact such strangers whenever
needed without worrying about their privacy.
Whatsapp the UPI payment feature to its commercial as well as business App in the near future. Thus if need arises, ANON can serve as a fit way of transfering money and
paying bills to unknown people, that too right on the go!

The various features we wish to add to our app are:
Mass Messaging in Whatsapp, for spreading information faster among general public.
Temporarily saving contact info within app for later use.
Ability to backup chats with unknown contacts.  

Novelty of the ANON
The Idea for this project arises from ‘having read the WhatsApp public API documentation’ which stated an API that could create chat links with a given Contact.
Novelty or Originality of concept remains the essence of this project.
We will try to make our project as Original & Innovative as possible by constantly adding our own innovative ideas.

Real Time Usage:
How our app can be used in real time scenario-
1. We being students can send any assignment or tutorial related work to anyone without saving the number as our app is meant for these purposes only.
2. When WhatsApp will start digital transfer of money, then we can transfer money without saving the contact info, for faster transactions.
